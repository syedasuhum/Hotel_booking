 Developed a hotel booking website using the Wizard control in ASP.NET, creating a seamless and user-friendly experience for both hotel managers and customers. The Wizard control, known for guiding users through a series of steps in a structured manner, was an ideal choice for building a multi-step booking process that ensures all necessary details are captured efficiently and accurately.
 This one is first step of hotel booking process where I added the validation for date and disabling the previous date
